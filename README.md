largexmlfileparser
==================
Implementation of importing records from large XML file into database using Stax API. Concepts of transaction management & batch update prepared staments are used from spring for efficient & clean implementation. Test cases verifying total count of records are also implemented using Junit4. These test cases verify only record count and they dont verify data as of now. Will add more test cases in next commit. Will also add SAX implementation for XML parsing.
